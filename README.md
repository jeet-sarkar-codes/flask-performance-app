# Flask Performance App

This is a simple Python Flask API project created to demonstrate basic backend development and performance awareness. The application consists of two endpoints and is manually tested for simulated load.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Flask Web Framework
- Manual Load Testing (browser-based)
- GitHub for version control and portfolio visibility

## 🚀 Endpoints

| Route         | Description                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `/`           | Returns welcome message        |
| `/hello`      | Returns personalized message   |

## 📊 Performance Testing Summary

Performed manual testing by refreshing endpoints in multiple tabs and devices:

- Simulated 10, 50, 100 concurrent requests
- Measured response time using Chrome Dev Tools
- No lag or errors under test conditions
- Results documented in [PerformanceReport.txt](./PerformanceReport.txt)
